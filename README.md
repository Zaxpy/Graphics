# Themes, Icons and Graphic Design
A public collection of my graphical design projects and resources.

## Web Themes
### Discord
- [Shadecord](https://github.com/Zaxpy/Web-Themes/blob/main/Discord%20Themes/shadecord.theme.css): A higher contrast Discord theme.

## Icons
You can find a collection of completed icons [here](https://github.com/Zaxpy/Graphics/tree/main/Icons). These will soon be collated into files for easy installation on Android and KDE Plasma.
